### My Portfolio
<p>Welcome to my NextJS portfolio project! In this repository, I explore the integration of NextJS with Tailwind CSS. Initially, my goal was to experiment with NextJS, and considering the current trend, I planned to incorporate Tailwind CSS into the project. However, I found the process of adding class names cumbersome and halfway through, I considered using ChakraUI as an alternative. Ultimately, I decided to stick with Tailwind CSS since I had already made significant progress.

### Technology Stack
- NextJS: I chose NextJS as the foundation for this project due to its robust features and efficient server-side rendering capabilities.
- Tailwind CSS: Despite the initial challenges with class names, I embraced the popular utility-first CSS framework for styling purposes.
- EmailJS: I integrated EmailJS to streamline email functionality within the application.
- React Feather: For a visually appealing touch, I utilized React Feather icons to enhance the overall design.
- Sonner: Handling notifications is crucial, and I incorporated Sonner to manage notifications seamlessly.
- Framer Motion: Adding a touch of animation, I included Framer Motion to create dynamic and engaging user interfaces.
- Vercel: For deployment and hosting, I utilized Vercel because it's free (very honest opinion lol).
- Google Analytics: To gain insights into website traffic and user behaviour, I integrated Google Analytics into this project.
